# Arduino_Jump_Game
A simple LCD game where players try to survive as long as they can by jumping to avoid obstacles.

Original code provided by Arduino Community

I added code to introduce an active buzzer (off-balance motor) for sound effects. Now plays a small sound effect when jumping and plays a losing tone when player collides into an obstacle.
